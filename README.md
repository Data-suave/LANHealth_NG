# LANHealth NG

LANHealth NG is a prototype Digital health assistant built with Python and Streamlit. It helps Nigerians understand symptom urgency, get calm guidance, and find nearby hospitals or emergency contacts.

This is not a replacement for medical advice. It’s a human-centered tool designed to reduce anxiety and support decision-making during health concerns.
